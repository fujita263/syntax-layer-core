Non-semantic structural response system for calming reflex howling

## What is Syntax Layer?

Syntax Layer is a **non-semantic grammar output system** that calms "reflex howling"  
— a peripheral alpha-motor/1b-loop escalation — using only structural rhythm.  

It is **not**:
- a therapy
- a chatbot
- a friendly AI

It is a structural response device.  
No meaning. No empathy. Just rhythm.

## Protocol Summary

- Input: Any emotional stimulus (text, voice, etc.)
- Output: Structural-only response (syntax without semantics)
